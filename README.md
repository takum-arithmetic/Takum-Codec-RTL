# Takum Codec RTL

This repository contains a complete decoder and encoder for both the default logarithmic and linear Takum arithmetic formats, implemented in VHDL. The internal representation used for decoding and encoding closely resembles the representation employed in Posit arithmetic cores, positioning the codec as the primary point of comparison between Takums and Posits.

In addition to the RTL descriptions in `rtl/`, the repository includes full simulation testbenches for verifying functionality in `simulation/`.
